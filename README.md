# code_sample
A sample of data analysis and machine learning projects.

This repo is made up of 3 main sections:
  1. Machine Learning Projects
  2. Python scripts not related to machine learning
  3. C++ code for a relational database for BYU's CS 236 course

## Summaries
Summaries of the contents of each folder are listed below.

#### Machine Learnint Projects
  1. iPython notebooks for an implementation of Gibbs Sampling and Metropolis MCMC algorithms.
  2. A toolkit and python scripts to run various machine learning algorithms.
    a. Details on how to run the algorithms are included in the toolkit_to_run_learner_files folder README.md doc.
    b. Please note that while the actual machine learning algorithms are my code, the toolkit is not.
    c. Analysis on said algorithms is included as a PDF
  3. Several other python files iPython notebooks are included demonstrating other machine learning algorithms in python's sklearn and          keras.
  
#### Python Scripts
  Primarily includes python files and iPython notebooks on modeling and solving differential equations, as well as demonstrations for       using programs like SQL and implementing algorithms for facial recognition and image segmentation.
